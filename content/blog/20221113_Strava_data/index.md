A couple of weeks ago, I embarked on a journey to create my own dashboard using the **Strava APIs**. As a long-time user of the app, I was looking for a way to gain a deeper understanding of my workout data.

&nbsp;

My main goal was to access past data and track my training progress over time. And to my surprise, I discovered that 2022 was the year I trained the most since I stopped competing in [short track](/blog/20211201_short_track/) for the Italian national team.

The dashboard provides interactive charts, aggregated information, and automatically generates detailed report pages for the selected sport.. Check out the video below to see a sneak peek.

**The complete code for this project is available on [Github](https://github.com/regedo00/strava-data-viz)**, even though it is still a work-in-progress.
