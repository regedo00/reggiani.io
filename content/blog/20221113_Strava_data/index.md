A couple of weeks ago, I embarked on a journey to create my own dashboard using the **Strava API**. As a longtime user of the app, I wanted to find a way to gain more insight into my workout data without upgrading to a premium account 😎. 

&nbsp;

My main goal was to access past data and track my training progress over time. And to my surprise, I discovered that 2022 was the year I trained the most since I stopped competing in [short track](/blog/20211201_short_track/) for the Italian national team.

The dashboard provides overall statistics and automatically generates individual pages with detailed plots for each selected sport. Check out the video below to see a sneak peek.

**The complete code for this project is available on [Github](https://github.com/regedo00/strava-data-viz)**, even though it is still a work-in-progress.
