&nbsp;

Yesterday, I stumbled upon [this essay](https://www.nfx.com/post/how-to-prepare-for-an-upturn) by **NFX**  that offered recommendations for founders in preparation for a potential market recovery ðŸ¤ž. 

&nbsp;

After two years of enduring contraction of the venture landscape, this essay tries to put a glimmer of hope on the horizon. 

&nbsp;

On the other hand, as [Crunchbase funding statistics](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-vc-startup-funding-october-2023-monthly-report-data) ðŸ“‰ show, October 2023 registered a disheartening -24% decline compared to the same month last year, which had already distanced itself from the 2021 peak. 

&nbsp;

A market turnaround doesn't appear to be imminent. Nevertheless, there are numerous takeawaysðŸ“Œ from the essay. 

&nbsp;

In addition to the array of guidance provided to founders on how to be adequately prepared, the statement at the beginning of this post caught my attention. 

&nbsp;

The question arises: what impact will AI have in this scenario? 

&nbsp;

According to [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi) ðŸ“Š, there have been more than 248,000 tech-related layoffs worldwide since the start of the year. Following more than 164k in 2022.

&nbsp;

While the root causes may vary significantly from company to company, the outcome remains consistent â€” smaller teams. 

&nbsp;

It is plausible that with fewer personnel, productivity needs to be 'augmented,' and as per the article here comes the AI.âœ¨

&nbsp;

The notion of less specialized roles, facilitated by AI's ability to cover multiple domains, is undeniably intriguing. 

&nbsp;

As a non-expert in the field of HR, it appears to counter the prevailing trend in recent years, characterized by a strong emphasis on specialization.

&nbsp;

Is this the direction that OpenAI's GPTs are taking us?

&nbsp;

A future where one person can perform (at a high level) multiple roles thanks to specific design agents?

&nbsp;

We will see! Personally, I'm pretty thrilled about how work will evolve in the next years ðŸ˜Ž
