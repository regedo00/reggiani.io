Travelling has always been one of my greatest passions, ever since I was a teenager.

&nbsp;

Over the years I have always tried to find time to travel as much as I could, especially with friends. And early on, when there was no Instagram  and pictures were taken with a camera and not a smartphone, I started keeping track of the places I visited on a map. At first, it was a paper map with pencil marks, which soon turned into a google maps.

&nbsp;
 
Then in 2020  Covid-19 came, which prevented everyone from traveling and relegated us at home in front of the TV or PC, and since I was learning Python at the time, I decided to replicate the old map with a new version, Python generated.
