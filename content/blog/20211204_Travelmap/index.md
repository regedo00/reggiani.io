Travelling has always been one of my greatest passions, ever since I was a teenager.

&nbsp;

Throughout the years, I have always made an effort to find time to travel as much as possible, especially with friends.  In the past, before the widespread use of Instagram and smartphone cameras, I used to keep track of the places I visited on a map. At first, it was a paper map with pencil marks, but eventually, I switched to using Google Maps. 

&nbsp;

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic prevented people from traveling and kept us all confined to our homes in front of screens. As I was learning Python at the time, I decided to recreate my old map using a Python-generated version. **You can find the full screen map** [**here**](images/map.html)
