I'm currently serving as Managing Director at [ClubDeal Digital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clubdeal-digital/), an Italian wealth tech company. ClubDeal Digital offers sophisticated tools for managing private asset investments, as well as syndicate and ESOP management, catering to both startups, corporates and investors.

&nbsp;

In the past few years I've been the Head of Growth at [BacktoWork](https://www.backtowork24.com), a platform with the mission to enable Italian startups to secure funds from retail and HNWI investors through syndicates & community rounds. I joined as one of the first employees and followed the company's growth through a management buyout (from the previous owner [Gruppo 24 Ore](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruppo_24_ORE)), the acquisition of another startup, a 4 million Series A round from [Intesa Sanpaolo](https://group.intesasanpaolo.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019/06/CNT-05-000000053513A)'s CVC, and the acquisition of majority stake from Intesa's parent company. From 2018 to 2023, we supported companies like [WeRoad](https://www.weroad.travel/), [e-Novia](https://e-novia.it/en/), [Xnext](https://www.x-next.com/), [Contents.com](https://www.contents.com/), [Weart](https://weart.it/), [Davinci](https://davincisalute.com/), [Sardexpay](https://www.sardexpay.net/), and many more raising over €80 million.

&nbsp;

I used to be a pro [speed skater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-track_speed_skating) for the Italian National Team, competing in international races worldwide. In 2009, I was part of the [European Champion Relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_European_Short_Track_Speed_Skating_Championships). 

&nbsp;

I'm passionate about endurance sports like running, cycling, and mountaineering. Among others, I've summited [Yuhin Peak](https://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=-82489) (5130m), [Mont Blanc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc) (4805m, via the Italian Route), and [Monte Rosa](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Rosa) (4559m).

&nbsp;

Enthusiastic about innovation and technology. Every week, I curate [☕Tech Readings of the Week](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7039008827605692416/?displayConfirmation=true) on LinkedIn — a handpicked selection of insightful tech readings, reports, educational gems, and memes.

&nbsp;

I love being on the road travelling. I've explored more than [50 countries](../../stuff/20211204_travelmap/) so far. In 2014 I completed the [Mongol Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Rally) with 7 friends, driving a van from Milan (Italy) to Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia); more than 13.500 km of asphalt and dirt roads.
