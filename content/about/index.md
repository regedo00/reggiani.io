&nbsp;

I'm currently serving as Managing Director at [ClubDeal Digital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clubdeal-digital/), a regulated Italian fintech company on a mission to simplify private markets. ClubDeal Digital was created to break down the bureaucratic barriers and technological limitations that make private markets inefficient and hold back companies, investors, and intermediaries.

&nbsp;

I also serve as Director of [Spazio2023](https://spazio2023.space/), a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) founded in 2023 with the specific goal of investing in the Series C round of [D-Orbit S.p.A.](https://www.dorbit.space/), an Italian pioneer in space logistics and orbital transportation.

&nbsp;

Previously, I was Head of Growth and a shareholder at [BacktoWork](https://www.backtowork24.com), a platform helping Italian startups raise capital from retail and HNWI investors through syndicates and community rounds. I joined as one of the first employees and had the chance to contribute to the company’s growth through milestones such as a management buyout from [Gruppo 24 Ore](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruppo_24_ORE), the acquisition of another startup, a €4M Series A round from [Intesa Sanpaolo](https://group.intesasanpaolo.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019/06/CNT-05-000000053513A)'s CVC, and later the acquisition of a majority stake by Intesa itself.  
From 2018 to 2023, we supported companies including [WeRoad](https://www.weroad.travel/), [e-Novia](https://e-novia.it/en/), [Xnext](https://www.x-next.com/), [Contents.com](https://www.contents.com/), [Weart](https://weart.it/), [Davinci](https://davincisalute.com/), [Sardexpay](https://www.sardexpay.net/), and many others, raising more than €80M in total.

&nbsp;

Outside of work, I used to be a professional [short track speed skater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-track_speed_skating) with the Italian National Team, competing internationally. In 2009, I had the privilege of being part of the [European Champion Relay Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_European_Short_Track_Speed_Skating_Championships). 

&nbsp;

I'm passionate about endurance sports like running, cycling, and mountaineering. Among others, I've summited [Yuhin Peak](https://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=-82489) (5130m), [Mont Blanc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc) (4805m, via the Italian Route), and [Monte Rosa](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Rosa) (4559m).

&nbsp;

I love being on the road travelling. I've explored more than [50 countries](../../stuff/20211204_travelmap/) so far. In 2014, with 7 friends, I completed the [Mongol Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Rally) driving a van from Milan (Italy) to Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia); more than 13.500 km of asphalt and dirt roads.
