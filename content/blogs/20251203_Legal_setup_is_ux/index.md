Yesterday, I was listening to an [old interview](/https://open.spotify.com/episode/0cDyoIou824vpwgoLYgIZX?si=M4ZAUShWQhCasJuSBDL3cA) with **Palmer Luckey** where he shared a fascinating detail: in the early days of Anduril, the **ratio of lawyers to engineers** was actually skewed towards the legal team.

&nbsp;

A pretty counter-intuitive piece of data for a company that produces highly technological hardware.

&nbsp;

While yes, they deal in weapons, and that naturally inlfuences things, the takeaway is much broader. And simplification alone won't get you there.

&nbsp;

In highly regulated industries, technology alone doesn't get very far without the right legal setup and the necessary *proactive legal mindset*.

&nbsp;

This immediately made me think about the **analogy to fintech**.

&nbsp;

In the financial sector, you simply can't move forward without a solid legal foundation. One that actively seeks to evolve the *status quo*, rather than just policing it.

&nbsp;

The issue is not just about having the ability to do or not do something, such as launching a new feature, a service, or anything else.

&nbsp;

It's fundamentally about *"how"* you are able to deliver it.

&nbsp;

It is a matter of pure and simple **User Experience**.

&nbsp;

A UX that is defined not just by the digital interface, but by the **underlying layer** that enables the interface itself.

&nbsp;

It's a matter of  **leveraging the regulation**, rather simply being constrained by it.

&nbsp;

With strong foundations, it becomes much easier to build something truly useful and beautiful.

&nbsp;

And User Experience is (often) what determines whether a product not only manages to launch but, above all, manages to stay on the market.
