It's **2025**. In Italy (and in many other spots across good old Europe), transferring shares of a privately held company still demands a **physical visit to a notary**. Yes, even if the seller must fly in from the other side of the globe.

&nbsp;

If those shares aren't digitized, the seller has to bring a paper certificate with them. On this ancient, **massive piece of paper**, we must stick an **adhesive stamp** with the seller's signature, which the notary then 'authenticates'.

&nbsp;

But if even one solitary signature is absent from that relic of a certificate, the notary (quite rightly) stops the entire proceeding. 

&nbsp;

The only recourse then is for the seller's **lawyer's unfortunate junior** (or, generally, the most junior person in the room) to grab the certificate, jump in the car, **drive nearly 100 km just to chase down that signature**, and then rush back. 

&nbsp;

If it's 5 PM, that’s when the real fun begins.

&nbsp;

So, the real question is: What arrives first? An **AI capable of enabling a humanoid robot to perfectly mimic the junior's 200km paper chase**, or an actual and deep system change?

&nbsp;

We'll see. 

&nbsp;

In the meantime, keep building 🛠️
