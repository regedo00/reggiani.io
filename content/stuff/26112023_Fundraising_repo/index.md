Fundraising is (most likely) a crucial step if you're aiming to scale your startup. 

&nbsp;

Whether you're courting pre-seed angels or eyeing venture capital funds, there are numerous aspects to consider, a plethora of unwritten rules to (probably) adhere to, and a minefield of potential mistakes to sidestep. 

&nbsp;

On top of that, the journey is often long and challenging, even if you happen to stumble upon this post after the 2022/23 fundraising winter.

&nbsp;

To assist anyone venturing into this challenging realm, I've compiled all the resources I've bookmarked (and likely shared through my weekly newsletter) into [**this GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/regedo00/trw-startup-resources). 

&nbsp;

I want to create a one-stop shop for free fundraising knowledge with no commercial agenda. The list is on GitHub so that **everyone can contribute and expand this knowledge base**. I hope it will become a valuable resource for anyone taking the first steps through fundraising.

&nbsp;

**To all the (wannabe) founders out there, best of luck** with your raise!
